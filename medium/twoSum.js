/**
 * Create a function that will take 2 arguments, an array and a number, and then return
 * true or false if there are two numbers within the array that total to the second number.
 *
 * Example input: ([1, 2, 3], 6)
 * Expected output: false
 *
 * input: ([1, 2, 9], 11)
 * output: true
 *
 * input: ([91, 44, 1, 19], 91)
 * output: false
 * (two numbers must sum to the target)
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: some of the lists are very long, and you will have to account
 * for load times. Bonus points if it is under 4 seconds. Some lists may have more
 * than one solution, this is fine. You will only need to return true of any solutions
 * exist, or false if none exist.
